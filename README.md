# OPTIMIZATION-MODEL
This project demonstrates the application of optimization techniques, 
specifically Linear Programming (LP), to solve a real-world business problem 
in supply chain management. The solution minimizes transportation costs while 
satisfying operational constraints, providing actionable insights for 
data-driven decision-making.

PROBLEM STATEMENT


A manufacturing company operates three factories (Factory A, B, and C) that 
supply products to four warehouses (Warehouse 1, 2, 3, and 4). Each factory 
has a limited production capacity, and each warehouse has specific demand 
requirements. The transportation cost varies between each factory-warehouse 
pair.

BUSINESS CHALLENGE:
How can the company minimize total transportation costs while ensuring:
- All warehouse demands are met
- No factory exceeds its production capacity
- All shipments are non-negative

This is a classic "Transportation Problem" in Operations Research, perfectly 
suited for Linear Programming optimization.
FEATURES:
- Automated problem setup and solving
- Real-time solution status reporting
- Multi-format output (console, Excel, visualizations)
- Professional-grade charts and dashboards

This project successfully demonstrates how optimization techniques can solve
complex business problems efficiently. By applying Linear Programming to a
supply chain distribution challenge, we achieved measurable cost savings,
optimal resource allocation, and actionable strategic insights.

The solution is not merely theoretical—it provides a production-ready tool
that businesses can implement immediately for real-world distribution planning.
The comprehensive analysis, professional visualizations, and detailed
documentation make this project a complete demonstration of applying advanced
analytics to drive business value.
